# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# for i in 1..3 do
#   u = User.create({
#     email: "customer@#{i}",
#     encrypted_password: 123456,
#     account_name: Faker::Name.name,
#     phone: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number,
#     })
#   u.save
#   puts "customer@#{i} created"
# end
